[You can download my CV from here](/Vittorio_Faraco_CV.pdf).

My main interests are artificial intelligence and web development. I like to design and build models and solutions that solve real-world problems, especially in the health and wellness domains.

I advise companies on AI, data analysis, web-software development, and media. Working on full-stack applications, custom frontend or backend functionalities, data tools, chatbots, recommendation algorithms, and more, I am able to provide advanced solutions to interesting and challenging needs.

I also have a passion for thinking, talking, and sharing. This, combined with my tech and analytical background, led me to start sharing things online: I have multiple YouTube channels and websites where I share thoughts and connect with other amazing people. Visit both my [Italian channel](https://youtube.com/@VittorioFaraco) and my [English one](https://youtube.com/@VittorioFaraco2), and connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/vittoriofaraco) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vittoriofaraco) for more.
