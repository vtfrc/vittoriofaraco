[You can download my CV from here](/documents/Vittorio-Faraco-CV.pdf).

My main interests are Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I’m addressing my work towards studying different areas/tools like Causality, Reinforcement Learning, Recommender Systems, Fairness, and Conversational AI, especially in the health and wellness domains, where I think technology will play a huge role in the near future.

At the same time, I advise companies and professionals on AI, data, and media. Today’s tools can be game changers in terms of business opportunities and impact: my focus is on making sure that great realities sustainably grow and thrive, by taking full advantage of the current and future, rapidly-changing environment.

I also have a passion for thinking, talking, and sharing. This, combined with my tech and analytical background, led me to start sharing things in this hyperconnected world we live in today: I have multiple YouTube channels and websites where I share tips, thoughts, and lessons and connect with other amazing people. Visit both my [Italian channel](https://youtube.com/@VittorioFaraco) and my [English one](https://youtube.com/@VittorioFaraco2) for more.
