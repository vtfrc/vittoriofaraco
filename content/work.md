[You can download my CV from here](/Vittorio_Faraco_CV.pdf).

My main interests are technology, business, and media. I like to offer custom-tailored business consulting and to design and build tech solutions that solve real-world problems, especially in the health and wellness domains.

I currently work as a backend engineer at [Blue Reply](https://www.reply.com/blue-reply/it/). I also advise companies on business development, IT infrastructure, AI and data solutions, and operations management. On the technical side, working on full-stack applications, custom frontend or backend functionalities, data tools, chatbots, recommendation engines, and more, I am able to provide advanced solutions to exciting and challenging needs. Besides Python as a general scripting language and data-oriented tool, some of my other favorite technologies are currently Laravel, Nuxt, Supabase, and MySQL.

I love thinking, talking, and sharing. This, combined with my tech and analytical background, made me want to start sharing things online: I have multiple YouTube channels and outlets where I share thoughts and connect with other amazing people. Visit both my [Italian channel](https://youtube.com/@VittorioFaraco) and my [English one](https://youtube.com/@VittorioFaraco2), and connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/vittoriofaraco), [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/vittoriofaraco), and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/vittoriofaraco) for more.
