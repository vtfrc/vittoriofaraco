Some of the coolest things I watch and read online are pieces of content on projects built by smart people, live.

If you’re into tech and engineering, you’ve probably stumbled across some YouTube video of some pretty smart FAANG (MAANG?) software engineer building THE side project because their normal job wasn’t enough. Relatable, ah?

This trend is taking more and more place across the tech community online, and I fully support it honestly.

The idea of building a product in public, testing it as soon as possible, collecting responses and feedback, iterating, seems like the perfect way of building a startup today - while also creating entertaining content for potentially loads of people to watch and enjoy.

Recently, I’ve followed Jedcal’s adventure while building RateMyDorm, a service that offers dorm reviews for American college students. I also watch Fireship’s content basically on a daily basis, and always remain shocked at the amount of ideas and the level of execution and excitement this guy has and is able to spark.
